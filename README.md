# Stat_MaskL
Here are files for a project in statistical machine learning
Boosting_algorithm.py uses booth AdaBoost and GradientBoosting with an ensamble of n=100 and important parameters found from
featureimportance.py

featureimportance.py uses randomforests to find the most important features, prints it in order as well as plots it 
together with its standard deviation from. 

Dataset is made to training and validation from splittning and using k-fold crossvalidation with k=10.
